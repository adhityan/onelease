Event Description  You should take into consideration that the way you present yourself or your product is one of the key factors for your success and it is something that is often not taken seriously into consideration.    Google the word image and you will find:      a representation of the external form of a person or thing in art – Synonyms: likeness\, resemblance        a simile or metaphor    …and finally\,        the general impression that a person\, organization\, or product presents to the public – Synonyms:  public perception\, persona\, profile\, reputation\, stature\, standing; face    What is not in Google is our process.
