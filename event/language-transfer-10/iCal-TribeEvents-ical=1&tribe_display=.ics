SUMMARY:Language Transfer
DESCRIPTION:Communication is supposed to be simple\, right?    The truth is that things get lost in translation and in transfer. There are gaps. You’ll know what gaps I mean:     If you’ve read a book in its original language and in a target language   If you’ve pitched or presented and wondered about whether your audience got your message   If you’re working on a text\, on a website or on a book and need a second pair of eyes to help you crisp your content   If you’ve sat in a language class that hasn’t been very engaging to you and you’ve wanted more    So close the gaps: jump\, rocket or build a bridge. We’ll help.    We have over 10 years experience working with people in design\, the health sector\, media\, engineering and academia. If quality     wording and wordology\,   translations and editing\,   language learning\,   language coaching and   teaching and content transfer methods    are on your mind\, come and find me.    Book your spot via eventbrite.    &nbsp;    Looking forward to meeting you\,    Jeanette    Sponsored by NATIVES GmbH &amp; Co. KG    Wir l(i)eben Sprachen.    &nbsp;
