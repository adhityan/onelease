SUMMARY:The Pitch Doctor
DESCRIPTION:Public Speaking and Presenting  A (future) professional must be able to confidently present his or herself. A presentation succeeds because of content and the way you communicate. In this workshop we will look at your choice of words\, your posture and movement\, your appearance\, and the use of your voice.  It’s not about the right way\, but about your way of presenting. We start with your skills and teach you how to deploy them. To achieve this we work with exercises that are derived from theatre. This way you get a clear picture of how you come across and what suits you.  SESSION OVERVIEW:  In the first Part of the Workshop you will focus on the ability to grab audience attention and Storytelling skills. In the Second we will look at how to create a Pitch. Each contender will get feedback on their individual Pitch presentation. When it comes to working with empathy\, charisma and expression\, we apply theatrical methods. The theatrical exercises are taught in groups\, with a focus on the individual.  INSTRUCTOR: Bjørn de Wildt  Bjørn studied at the Fontys Academy for Theater in Tilbug (NL) and was named “Talent of the year 2008”.
