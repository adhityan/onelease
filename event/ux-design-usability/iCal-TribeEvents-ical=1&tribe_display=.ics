SUMMARY:UX Design &amp; Usability
DESCRIPTION:Develop an interaction-rich experience  User experience design and usability are critical factors for all companies to develop sustainable customer relationships. Also\, as a rule of thumb\, you can say\, every 1 euro you invest in Usability and UX\, saves 10 euros in development and 100 euros after the initial product launch.

This UX design &amp; Usability course for beginners will teach you all the important basics from scratch about user centered design\, web and application design and usability testing.
