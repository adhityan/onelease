SUMMARY:The Sound Box
DESCRIPTION:Find your melody   As with any other woodworking project\, this time we're going to create a beautiful sounding Cajon drum box. This box-shaped hand percussion instrument has its origins in 18th century Peru. During this interactive course you’ll learn how to create the Cajón drum out of wood and learn to play this handmade craft.  You can buy cajons online or in music stores; however\, they're not difficult to make and let's be honest making one yourself is not only really cool it will sound even more better!  So from now on when you will meet your friends for an evening full of music\, food and drink\, you can bring your very own Cajón with you and play with then anywhere you want!  SESSION OVERVIEW    Session 1  We will kick off the course with a quick history and usage recap of the Cajon and getting to know more about the different wood types we will use. Right after that you’ll get your hands dirty! You’ll be making it’s shelve out of wood. You’ll receive all materials already precut by our master and the bits you need to assemble into the Cajón. In order to make it perfect and sound just right\, you’ll need to work on the pieces by using different tools such as sanders and drills. Once your pieces are ready\, you will take the leap into assembling it all together\, making sure everything is aligned.    Session 2   The second session we’ll devote to finishing the structure and assembling the Cajón together. Making sure the sounds are clean and accurate. To finish the course in a musical mood you will give your Cajón a try.    INSTRUCTORS: Lluis Mateu  Lluis Mateu is a woodworking enthusiast with more than 25 years of experience.
