SUMMARY:Vegetable Fermentation
DESCRIPTION:Release the flavour  In an anti-bacterial age\, fermentation is quickly becoming a lost art. We are here to reclaim it as an energy efficient food-preservation technique which is rooted in our cultural histories. We are captivated and inspired by the way fermented foods engage our senses and enhance whole food eating.  Discover the science and unique flavours of fermented vegetables around the world. From classic sauerkrauts to pickled Asian vegetables to the spicy and tangy flavours of South American cuisine. Every one will have the opportunity to make a custom kraut. Bring a curious appetite.  ABOUT THE WORKSHOP  In this workshop we will talk about everything PROBIOTICS and fermentation. Alexis will introduce to you the importance of your own micro-biome by introducing fermented foods\, traditional and cultural uses\, nutrition and the microbiology behind their creation. We will also discuss resources as well as tips and safety tricks of this culinary art form.  Everyone should come with a curious appetite and open mind and leave with a jar of delicious\, custom made vegetable kraut that one can observe during the weeks ahead.  INSTRUCTOR: ALEXIS GOERTZ  The 25 year old Canadian Bacteria-Barista\, Alexis\, co-founded Edible Alchemy in Winnipeg\, Canada in 2013\, and after exploring more of the world of fermentation over many travels brought Edible Alchemy to Berlin in September 2014. The enthusiasm and desire to share about the wondrous world of fermentation has brought Edible Alchemy to classrooms\, festivals\, farmer’s markets\, rooftops\, studio spaces and on European and Canadian tours. Working with fermentation is an accessible way to have a little laboratory in the kitchen\, which Alexis loves doing experiments and seeing people get really excited about taking back traditional food\, deskilling to create self-reliance.  MATERIALS:  All the materials will be provided at the workshop.  QUESTIONS:  Drop us a line at academy@betahaus.de
