SUMMARY:Intellectual Club 60 Sekund
DESCRIPTION:The Club welcomes all Russian speakers\, who are willing to get together weekly to test their knowledge and agility in a team competition. For some it is just social activities\, for others – a hobby and the position in the score table.    About the Club  The format of the Club’s events is competition: teams of 3-6 people are to get as many correct answers to the questions that are asked by the host as possible (three rounds with 12 questions each). The teams have 60 seconds for discussion of each question and submission of the answer\, all correct answers are counted and fixed in the score table. The questions are prepared by the editorial group: it is important that they do not require deep knowledge in various areas – the answers are found with the help of associations\, logic\, sense of humor\, and teamwork. Our websites in Russian: http://club60sec.de/\, http://club60sec.ru/.    Our members  The Club welcomes all Russian speakers across Europe\, CIS\, and Russia\, who are willing to get together weekly to test their knowledge and agility in a team competition.
