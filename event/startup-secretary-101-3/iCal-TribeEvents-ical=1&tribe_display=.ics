SUMMARY:Startup Secretary 101
DESCRIPTION:betahaus | Office Hours are one-on-one free consultancy sessions (30 mins) with experts from our community to our community.    Event Description    Of course\, the most important thing to work on is your product/service. But what about all the other things required by the german bureaucracy that is feared across the whole world? Or the investors? Or your customers?        We assist young companies in structuring their back office operations.  Central to our service is the implementation of systems and the establishment of reliable and effective communication with all the service providers and public authorities with which our clients interact.  One of our core areas of operation is assisting our clients to navigate the complicated legal and tax requirements involved in starting and running a business.   We take care of all the things you\, as a founder and a busy and motivated entrepreneur\, don't have to do. We help you to have answers for all the questions you are going to be asked by german officials\, investors etc.        About Event Holder - Jakob Ballestrem    Jakob Ballestrem worked on various projects with all kinds of people\, companies and Start-Ups.
