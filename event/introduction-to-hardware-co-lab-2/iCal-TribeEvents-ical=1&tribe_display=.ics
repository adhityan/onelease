SUMMARY:Introduction to Hardware.co Lab
DESCRIPTION:Do you have a cool idea for an electronic gadget? In our brand new electronics lab\, we have the tools you need to build your prototype. In this one-day course for beginners\, you'll get a basic introduction to building electronics and using the tools in the lab.    Electronic circuits are everywhere around us. All the technological gadgets we see today\, are made up of electronic circuits. If you have an idea for a physical product\, there is a big chance you will need some form of an electronic circuit.    &nbsp;    YOU WILL LEARN:     Build a circuit   Understand circuit diagrams   Do simple calculations to find the correct component values   Measure current\, voltage and resistance   Use the tool in our Hardware Lab   Learn how to start solving circuit bugs    &nbsp;    WORKSHOP HOLDER:    Øyvind is a maker\, writer\, teacher\, entrepreneur and digital nomad who's currently based in Berlin. His mission is to teach the world how to build electronics. Since he was a little boy he has been interested in building stuff\, especially using programming and electronics. In 2009 he finished a Msc. in Electronics and Computer Technology from the University of Oslo. Then he founded and worked as the CEO of Intelligent Agent from 2009 till 2012\, where they developed see-through-wall radar sensors for robotics. In 2012 he decided to focus on teaching and inspiring people to build stuff with electronics. And he has been teaching electronics through books and courses on his website ever since. Today his online articles has been viewed more than a million times.    Øyvind loves to teach and is known for explaining things in a simple and clear way. He has been  teaching classes at the University of Oslo and spoken at several MakerFaire\, Hackerspace and  similar types of events.
