SUMMARY:Code in Ruby
DESCRIPTION:Focus on simplicity and productivity  If you’re nowadays work within a startup\, the earliest questions you will need to answer will be: What is the best programming language for my startup? Even with limited experience you’re still able to develop your own web application. In this case a great software you always can consider is Ruby.    When you spend hours and hours a day writing code\, it’s the little things that make a huge difference. Ruby’s usability is much easier than in other programming language\, because the language is super flexible and very forgiving and speaks in terms that are more human and less computer. This way you will spend more time absorbing programming fundamentals and less time banging your head against your desk.    SESSION OVERVIEW     Session 1  In this session you will get to know your tutor and classmates and get straight into coding. We will set up your working environment and have a look at online code editors and cloud workspaces like Cloud9 or Nitrous. You will learn the basics of the Ruby programming language and by the end of the session you will have your first Rails app up and running in the cloud.    Session 2   This session starts by introducing the basics of every Rails app: models\, views\, controllers\, and routes. You will learn how to use models to create\, read\, update\, and delete records in the database (CRUD). We will write controller actions to handle incoming web requests and design clean and flexible views using layouts\, partials\, and helpers. At the end of the day you will have built your own interactive blog app.  Session 3   In this session we will build a more ambitious project. You will learn how to use git to version control your code and how to host your git repository with GitHub. We will also take a look at more advanced aspects of Rails like testing\, internationalization (I18n) and sending emails. By the end of the session you will have built a fancy music catalog app and deployed it to the web.    Session 4  Throughout the final session\, you will learn how to use a test-first development approach to confidently add new features. You will write and run high-level feature specs using Capybara and lower-level model specs using RSpec. Creating a Rails app that just works isn't the same as designing a good Rails app. So we will take a step further and cover design techniques for removing duplication and encapsulating business logic. You will also get tips and tricks used by the professionals to get the most out of Rails.    INSTRUCTOR: SEBASTIAN SCHLAAK  Sebastian is a professional developer with degrees in Management and Informatics and more than 10 years of practical experience in designing\, implementing\, and testing software.He has been working with Ruby since 2011\, after many years spent wandering the wilderness as a Java developer.  He loves exploring new technologies right when they're under the bleeding edge label. When not writing code\, Sebastian serves as team lead\, mentor and entrepreneurship advisor.
