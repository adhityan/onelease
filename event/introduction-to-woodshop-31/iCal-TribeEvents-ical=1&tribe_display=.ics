In this two-day course for rookies\, Lluis will give you a basic introduction into the machines and tools in the betahaus woodshop.    But it won’t just be learning the basics and getting to know the machines\, you will be building your own cool piece of furniture to be used as a Laptop desk or just a beautiful wooden bed tray. Through a shared\, basic\, and take-home project you will acquire enough skills to start working on simple projects afterwards.    SESSION OVERVIEW    First Session\, Friday: You will get to know the material and dig in into planning. How to approach the project with sketch. Once you perfected your design on paper you will transfer the measurements on the wood piece. How to measure the right way\, calculate material thickness and offcuts. In the last stage of first session you will make your first cut and learn who to securely use the table saw.    Second Session\, Saturday: On the second sessions you will continue working on your cuts and trying out different machines like miter saw\, the drill press and sanders. The time to assemble your table design will come. Learn to make different joints the advantages and disadvantages of different joint approaches.
