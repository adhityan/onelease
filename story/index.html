    <p>&nbsp;</p><h4><b>CHANGING CONSTELLATIONS &amp; POSSIBILITIES OF THE NEW MEDIA ERA</b></h4>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400">The world is constantly changing, and the way we work is changing with it. Value is being created in various locations, at different times and in ever changing constellations. There are less permanent jobs on offer, yet there are more possibilities than ever before to build something yourself: either as an entrepreneur, a startup, a freelancer, a maker, or a combination of these. There is a secular shift towards more flexible, entrepreneurial and collaborative work styles. Rather than at a peak, we believe that we are at the beginning of a deep societal trend that is transforming both industrialized countries and the developing world.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Internet offers intelligent, open networks that can be used to exchange knowledge and ideas, create and build products and services, and develop new forms of community. Yet in order to tap into those networks in a valuable way and make good use of them, we need a physical space. A space that creates energy and enthusiasm, while inspiring creativity and ambition; one that enables us to connect the vast possibilities of the digital economy to our everyday lives.</span>

    <p>&nbsp;</p><h4><b>RE-IMAGINE THE FUTURE OF WORK</b></h4>
    <p><b></b><span style="font-weight: 400">Traditional organizational structures and conventions like hierarchy, age, and proper career paths aren’t relevant in betahaus. Once people walk in, they leave behind where they came from and they focus on the future. They do so with a drive to do something different or new, and with a positive and fresh idea on how they’d like to work. In betahaus they have the freedom to choose who they’d like to work with, how, where, and when. Just like AirBnB frees hospitality and Uber frees transport, betahaus frees work. </span>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span></p><h4><b>OPENING DOORS&nbsp;</b></h4>

        for their work station. Spread out over 5000 square meters on five levels, betahaus offers spaces and rooms
        designed to flexibly serve multiple purposes. Their ambiance range from the laid-back atmosphere of a cafe, to
        the seriousness of purpose found at a campus library. There are coworking spaces, a community space, team rooms,
        meeting rooms and event spaces in various sizes, a hardware lab, a wood workshop, and a café. Whenever you’re in
        and whatever you’re in for, you will always find a place that fits your needs. Whether it is to network and
        collaborate, or to have a productive day; to develop skills, push innovation, or exchange ideas and get
        inspired.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p><h4><b>LET’S WORK TOGETHER</b></h4>
    <p>You could work from home and find inspiration in a bunch of articles you read on TechCrunch and Entrepreneur.
        That’s great, but you may still be sitting around in your pyjamas at noon reading about things, instead of doing
        them. You might be dreaming about your future, instead of learning someone relevant for, or actually working on
        that future.&nbsp;At betahaus we believe that in order to take your work or project to the next level, you need
        to spend time with people and in spaces that foster inspiration, motivation, courage and know-how. In order to
        take it to the next level, you need to work together. Whether that is by having a spontaneous jam session with
        someone you just met in the hallway, or in the shape of an intense collaboration with someone on your
        wavelength. However you collaborate; it will help you accomplish goals and develop business opportunities.</p>
