				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">You&#8217;ll have seen their red scooters dotted around the city, but how many of you have actually ridden one? Well now’s your chance! betahaus just became a registration point for <a href="https://www.emio-sharing.de/en/">eMio Sharing</a> and with the sign up code &#8216;betahaus&#8217; you get your first 20 minutes of driving for free! </span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best part about eMio sharing is that you can use their electric scooters at any time! They also come with two helmets, so you can always give your friend a lift. As well as that, you don’t have to worry about charging them, as eMio takes care of that. Besides, even if you do jump on a scooter with 12% charge, that’s still 12km driving distance. They’re not just for city use, if you go out of the city the eMio will still work. Note, you’ll have to spend 5ct per minute parking when you&#8217;re out of the city area, but it means you can go on that day-trip to the lake!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Here&#8217;s how it works: </span></i></p>
<p><strong><br />
Step 1<br />
</strong>First, either go online and register or come to the betahaus reception and have your driving licence verified on the spot!</p>
<p><strong>Step 2<br />
</strong>Download the eMio-app to see all the scooters in your area. Then, select a scooter that’s close to you and reserve it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3<br />
</strong>Open the scooter with the app. As soon as you’re next to the scooter you&#8217;ll be able to hear the loud “CLICK”. This means the back box is unlocked, then you can grab the key and a helmet. Safety first!</p>
<p><strong>Step 4<br />
</strong>Put the key in the ignition, retract the stand and take off. Remember that since the scooter is electric no one can hear it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5<br />
</strong>Once you’re at your destination, park the scooter on the sidewalk, don’t worry it’s allowed! Then put everything back where it belongs. Close the helmet box and lock it by pushing the button in the app which says “end reservation”. Then once again, you’ll then hear the “CLICK” sound which shows that the box is locked and the rent has ended.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6<br />
</strong>You’ll get an email billing you with your journey, so you know how much money it cost you or how many free minutes you have left.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Something is bubbling in betahaus! It&#8217;s a kombucha brewery, founded by Alexis Goertz (you might know her from the betahaus café) and Clemens Gammer. Together they run </span></i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/mother.kombucha.berlin"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Mother Kombucha</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400">; the most well-known and widespread kombucha drink in Berlin. They serve a couple of restaurants like </span></i><a href="http://parker-bowles.com/en/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Parker Bowls</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> and <a href="http://www.standard-berlin.de/">Standard Pizza</a>, you may even have seen them in the craft beer shop <a href="http://lagerlagerberlin.de/">Lager Lager</a>! We met them to find out more about their tasty and healthy drink.</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Firstly, What is kombucha?</b></p>
<p><b>(Clemens):</b> Kombucha is a fermented tea, we produce it by using black tea, cane sugar, and water. Then we add a bacterial culture called ‘mother’ (a mixture between bacteria and yeast) and leave it to ferment for 10 days. I would call kombucha an energy and health drink, since the caffeine from the tea pumps you up whilst the bacteria helps your digestive system. It acts as a detox, something a few people here in Berlin need I think.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Are there any further health benefits?</b></p>
<p><b>(Clemens): </b>Lots of blogs and history books talk about the health benefits of kombucha, which is only partly scientifically proven. The best way to find is to drink it yourself. I personally can feel the positive effect it has on my body and the response I get from others reiterates that too. You feel energised and refreshed after drinking it, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s probably more refreshing than anything else I’ve had. So refreshing that a friend of mine drinks around 3 bottles a day!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>You&#8217;ve came along way in such a small amount of time, how did it all start?</b></p>
<p><b>(Clemens): </b>At the start betahaus in fact played an initial roll, I was making kombucha at home and didn’t know anyone else making it in Berlin. A friend of mine was at the Christmas market and called, informing me that there was a girl there demonstrating kombucha, within 5 minutes I was there. That was when Alexis and I met, since then we’ve become both very good friends and business partners.</p>
<p>We were then introduced to the owners of Cordobar, a one of the best wine bars and restaurants not only in Berlin, but Germany itself. The guys there love to experiment with food and invited us for a tasting session. They immediately loved our kombucha so we decided to make a go of it, that was only a year ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;A friend of mine was at the Christmas market and called, informing me that there was a girl there demonstrating kombucha, within 5 minutes I was there&#8221; </em></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>If we would have kombucha bacteria at home, what recipe would you recommend us to try?</b></p>
<p><b>(Clemens): </b>We’ve recently started making lemonade using Mother Kombucha as a base. You just add lime, mint leaves, elderflower syrup and of-course ice cubes. We’ve became addicted to this mix because it&#8217;s so simple to make and so refreshing in this hot weather!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>We heard you’re currently serving various restaurants and clubs in Berlin, can you tell us more?</b></p>
<p><b>(Alexis): </b>The first three places we were in were Cordobar, Parker Bowles and Industry Standard! All highly recommendable, young, and vibrant places here in Berlin. Actually, Parker Bowles’ bar manager, Fabian, has created some beautiful cocktails using our kombucha. One named Jerry Steiner, and my favourite; Queen mother breakfast lemonade, which is a gin based cocktail, infused with Earl Grey, lemon, maple syrup and obviously Mother Raw Kombucha..</p>
<p>We also have some new exciting partnerships. Firstly, the craft beer shop LagerLager and also Home Cafe in Neukölln. Go check them out, they’re all doing some truly amazing things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What else are you working on, tell us what you&#8217;ve got planned over the next coming months? </b></p>
<p><b>(Clemens): </b>The plan for this summer is to explore how refreshing kombucha can be, we’ll not only be experimenting with different flavours and cocktails but also events too. Mother Kombucha is all about refreshment and that&#8217;s where we want to push the boundaries.</p>
<p><b>(Alexis): </b>It’s really about making people understand what kombucha is too, that&#8217;s currently more important than trying to expand. It’s also difficult for us to grow as the expiry date for any bottle is 4 weeks. It&#8217;s because the drink is still technically ‘living’, so if you keep it for longer than 4 weeks, the bacteria will grow too big and the fizz will puts too much pressure on the bottle. Therefore our production cycle is very short and takes a lot of work, there is only three of us after all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;The plan for this summer is to explore how refreshing kombucha can be, w</em><em>e’ll not only be experimenting with different flavours and cocktails but also events too&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What’s the division in work &amp; tasks between you three?</b></p>
<p><b>(Clemens): </b>Our team currently consists of 3 core members and a lot of very dedicated friends helping out whenever possible. The roles and responsibilities are very liquid amongst our team, we all focus on our strengths, overall it’s the big decisions we make as a group. At the end of the day the goal is to create a great drink and deliver it to the people. That’s our common goal and that’s what we’re all working towards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>If you&#8217;d like to try Mother Kombucha, you can buy a bottle in the café for 3€! Clemens, Alexis and Timo are also working on producing a six pack for those of you who want to enjoy the drink at home! </em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Meet our new betahaus member <a href="https://about.holvi.com/en/">Holvi</a>, a digital bank for freelancers, startups and entrepreneurs. Built independently from end to end, and kitted out with tools to keep your bookkeeping paperless and on point, Holvi has been helping small businesses in Finland, Austria and now Germany to ditch big banks and manage their money better. We sat down with Holvi’s country manager for Germany and Austria, Leah Marie Zeppos, to discuss the insights Holvi has gained along their journey: from Helsinki to betahaus Berlin. </span></i></p>
<p><b><br />
</b><b>Holvi offers bookkeeping services for startups, but what problem exactly does Holvi solve?  </b></p>
<p>“Everyone working at Holvi has a background in entrepreneurship and freelancing, so we’ve all had firsthand experience with the problem that bookkeeping tends to get put off. A lot of startups might start off with a CEO, CTO, and maybe a marketing person. This set-up offers a variety of talents, but what&#8217;s missing is someone looking after the bookkeeping. Until all of a sudden the Finanzamt comes along after six months and says ‘By the way, you DO have to pay VAT, and you owe this much in income tax’, and then you’ve got a problem with liquidity on your hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;A lot of startups might start off with a CEO, CTO, and maybe a marketing person. In all this, there isn’t really someone there to look after the bookkeeping.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>These kinds of Finanzamt horror stories shouldn’t scare budding entrepreneurs from getting their business up and running. So how does Holvi help?</b></p>
<p>“When you’re just starting out, just being on top of when an invoice comes in or when an invoice has been paid is totally critical. Holvi makes sure you get an automatic notification on these sorts of things. For people who for instance have a tech background but not necessarily a bookkeeping background, Holvi offers a reassuring product. Going freelance or becoming an entrepreneur can be really frightening, especially from a German perspective. Holvi provides an added level of security.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Let’s talk about the name: Holvi means &#8216;</b><strong>vault&#8217;</strong> <b>in Finnish, a word that’s tied to not only security, but also to trust. Can you tell us a bit more about the concept of ‘trust’ for Holvi?</b></p>
<p>“When you deal with money, you are dealing with one of the most basic levels of trust. This, in particular, is a big hurdle for entering the German market.In order for Holvi to open a business bank account for customers, both European and individual member state laws require that we can confirm that this person is who they say they are, lives where they say they do, and runs the business that they claim to. The customer needs to feel comfortable providing us with their data online, and because of this, providing a safe space for customers is a number one priority.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;When you deal with money, you are dealing with one of the most basic levels of trust. This, in particular, is a big hurdle for entering the German market.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>In March of this year, Holvi was acquired by  BBVA, a large Spanish bank with demonstrated interest in fintech. How did Holvi decide that this would be the right move?</b></p>
<p>&#8220;Before Holvi, BBVA also partnered with Simple, who offers a very similar product to ours in the U.S. We were able to take this history into account when choosing a Fintech partner who could both mentor us and let us stay essentially independent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Why do you think it’s important that banks give their fintech partners freedom? </b></p>
<p>&#8220;BBVA bought Holvi because they wanted to be a part of this. BBVA is serious about going digital and their attitude towards innovation is one I&#8217;ve only seen from startups up to now. With BBVA we knew we&#8217;d have a partner who could help us grow without stifling the ‘startup’ part of who we are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>How do you see the relationship between banks and fintechs today? Why do some large banks still seem so resistant to the idea of partnering with fintechs?</b></p>
<p>“One thing that Holvi founder Tuomas often says to explain this is that the banks are like big ships. They take forever to turn, but once they do turn, they have huge momentum. Of course, banks and fintechs are competitors in that they’re fighting for investors&#8217; money.And fintechs definitely have the upper hand right now in lots of ways. But this doesn’t mean that big banks and fintechs are natural enemies. There’s a whole spectrum of fintech, from startups with total independence, to traditional banks offering part of the fintech package, to startups offering a fintech package built on the backbone of a bank. A lot of fintech experts like to say that there’s only one true way, but I’ve never heard them say there’s one true way <i>because.”</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Banks are like big ships. They take forever to turn, but once they do turn, they have huge momentum.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After months of hard work from our core team and with the help of our fantastic volunteers, we opened the gates at 3pm. Every inch of betahaus was decorated to make it look like a real festival.</p>
<p><a href="http://d2tjgupm4m2jnv.cloudfront.net/wp/assets/sites/2/20160811125611/13939547_10154018431494565_4013077066995938742_n.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35169 img-responsive" src="http://d2tjgupm4m2jnv.cloudfront.net/wp/assets/sites/2/20160811125611/13939547_10154018431494565_4013077066995938742_n.jpg" alt="13939547_10154018431494565_4013077066995938742_n" width="960" height="768" srcset="http://d2tjgupm4m2jnv.cloudfront.net/wp/assets/sites/2/20160811125611/13939547_10154018431494565_4013077066995938742_n.jpg 960w, http://d2tjgupm4m2jnv.cloudfront.net/wp/assets/sites/2/20160811125611/13939547_10154018431494565_4013077066995938742_n-300x240.jpg 300w, http://d2tjgupm4m2jnv.cloudfront.net/wp/assets/sites/2/20160811125611/13939547_10154018431494565_4013077066995938742_n-768x614.jpg 768w, http://d2tjgupm4m2jnv.cloudfront.net/wp/assets/sites/2/20160811125611/13939547_10154018431494565_4013077066995938742_n-370x296.jpg 370w, http://d2tjgupm4m2jnv.cloudfront.net/wp/assets/sites/2/20160811125611/13939547_10154018431494565_4013077066995938742_n-770x616.jpg 770w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a></p>
<p>The weather didn’t hold off the whole afternoon, so we made some quick alterations the party and enjoyed the party inside for an hour. Just in time for <a href="http://superheldentraining.de/">Jorn Hendrick</a>’s Superhero training workshop that was a huge success!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Get Ready for BETAPITCH Global and Investors Day 2016!</em></p>
<p>On October 15, <a href="http://betapitch.net">BETAPITCH</a> is combining two key events that bring the international startup scene together for one action-packed Saturday: BETAPITCH Global &amp; Investors Day! Investors Day connects fundseeking startups with leading international investors and key players in the field. Participating startups are invited for one-on-one personal talks, workshops, keynotes, panel discussions, and PR pitch training sessions. After a busy day of networking, the finale of wordwide startup competition BETAPITCH Global kicks off. Finalists from 14 global tech capitals will go head to head, pitching for the chance to win a 5000€, a trip to Silicon valley, coworking memberships at betahaus, and many more prizes.</p>
<p><strong>Evolution and growth of a Berlin-grown startup competition</strong></p>
<p>From 2015 to 2016, BETAPITCH has doubled in size, growing from 7 to 14 pitch events across tech capitals worldwide. The competition witnessed inspiring developments in Swedish startups, discovered a budding entrepreneurial community in Tirana, Albania, connected with the startup scene shaking up Cairo, and found brand new partners across five cities in China. What about the alumni startups? Last year’s winning startup <a href="http://www.betapitch.net/2016/06/15/catch-amin-zayani-last-year-winner-betapitch-global/">MedAngel</a> is already in use in medical clinics  around the world. <a href="https://medium.com/switch-less-do-more/productivity-done-right-9522417cf8cf#.rvj0ikwgq">Thingthing</a>, the productivity app and winner from Barcelona’s local BETAPITCH is rocking it at startup competitions including <a href="https://4yfn.com/">4YFN</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Startups lined up</strong></p>
<p>So who are the BETAPITCH local winners lined up to pitch at the Global finale this October? <a href="http://population.io/">Population.io</a> won the local competition in Vienna with their fascinating demographic data project. <a href="http://timeular.com/">Timeular</a>, an innovative piece of hardware that makes time-tracking easy, won the Berlin pitch back in April. <a href="http://www.nordicadventours.com/">Nordic Adventours</a> won the event in Jönköping, Sweden with their online platform to connect tour operators with adventurers in the Nordic wilderness. First prize in Hamburg went to sharing economy startup <a href="https://www.hoardspot.com/">Hoard</a>, and in Sofia, the coworking management platform <a href="https://officernd.com/">OfficeRnD</a> won. The winner in Tirana, Albania, was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/itforequality/">IT For Equality</a>, who update older wheelchairs with smart, connective capabilities. Still to come are the winners from Lisbon, Cairo, Nanjing, Beijing, Shenzen, Shanghai, Jiashan, and Seoul.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><em>Happy Thursday! Today we’re having our guest blog, <strong>written by </strong><span class="s1"><strong>Tom Laterveer &amp; Hagar Michel</strong></span><span class="s1"> from Animo. <a href="http://www.moreanimo.com/">Animo</a> is a Berlin-based organizational happiness and teamwork firm that </span><span class="s2">facilitates, trains and consults companies in building an organization people love to work for.<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">&#8230;</span></span></em></p>
<p>In our previous article <a href="http://www.betahaus.com/berlin/2016/07/a-plea-for-more-connection-in-the-workplace/">A plea for more connection in the workplace</a> we made clear why connectivity in the workplace is important. We spend most time in the office, but don’t know our co-workers that well at the end of the day. This while science and practice prove that feeling connected has many benefits in fueling personal and organizational performance. From our experience in helping teams work better together, we’ve selected a few very effective tools to inspire more humanness and connectivity in your team. Introduce them in your workplace with consistency and verve — and we are positive you will soon see the effects in your team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>1. Do a daily huddle</b></span></p>
<p>Ever seen a team sport that doesn’t do a huddle? Or <a href="https://youtu.be/E4F98joi104">Japanese children</a>, for that matter? By gathering together with your team for 5-10 minutes every morning, you can do a quick check-in on how each of you feel and what you’ll be working on today. This office-huddle encourages you to share information with your colleagues, and at the same time helps you to be up-to-date on how they are feeling and what’s going on in their (working) life. It will take some deliberation and practice to get used to the huddle, but it soon becomes second nature and a cornerstone in your day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>2. Display your mood on a mood-board</b></span></p>
<p>The IT department of a Danish company decided to place a mood-board in their office. Upon daily arrival, employees place a green or red tag next to their name. Green means “I’m having a good day”, while red means “I’m having a bad day”. The mood-board helps the team to share important information on their mood, giving space to making their member feel trusted and valued. This method also provides little space for people to walk around feeling bad for weeks. After somebody has put up a red marker for about a week, people come up to them and ask (and listen!) what’s up. We all have bad days, and they all pass. Instead of feeling the need to put on a happy-face, openness on their mood makes it easier for them to get out of a negative mood-state. In a way, it also gives people permission to have a bad day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>3. Start your meetings with a check-in </b></span></p>
<p>People can bring a lot to the table when they enter a meeting. Maybe they’re tired, or generally have a bad patch or bad day. A check-in gives room to these feelings, so that they do not have to be brought into the meeting (and maybe hi-jack it at a certain point). During the check-in that takes place right before a meeting, people just exchange information on how they feel. This requires no prior time-investment, no agendas, and no resolution on topics. These short periods allow people to identify in which ways they feel connected to (or disconnected from) the work at hand, the group process and their colleagues. Next to this, minor issues can be easily resolved through this face-to-face contact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>4. Build your companies’ ‘Wall off Praise’</b></span></p>
<p>Remember how good it feels to receive praise? To hear that you’ve done really well on as task, or in a relationship with someone? (Hint: glowing, beaming faces. Yes?). A London-based innovation agency invented the Wall of Praise. The idea is that every employee can nominate any other employee for their good deeds. The best nominations are pasted across the walls and ceiling in the busiest area of the office in big and colorful letters. The Wall of Praise, as the name easily suggests, gives us a hand in telling each other what we do well. We are all good at criticizing. Let’s talk about what others (and ourselves) do well. And what better place to see this in your meeting and reception area? Now all you need to do is to place a jar where people can put in their nominations, decide how you’ll determine the ‘winners’ and put them in the spotlight.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>5. Do a level 5 greeting!</b></span></p>
<p>So we just talked about the mood-board displaying ‘good’ and ‘bad’ moods. What about ending our list of tricks with a trick that will enhance the likelihood of you and your team having (or getting) a ‘good’ mood? You surely can relate to the following list that sums up the different approaches to saying good morning at work:</p>
<p>Level 0: ignoring others completely.</p>
<p>Level 1: grunting to the others.</p>
<p>Level 2: saying hi or good morning. Avoiding eye contact is key at level 2.</p>
<p>Level 3: Level 2, only now including the eye contact.</p>
<p>Level 4: Adding an extra verb or sentence. Maybe even asking a question like: “how are you?”</p>
<p>Level 5: Mix in some touching, a handshake or a pat on the shoulder. Hugging is allowed (as long as the other person agrees, of course).</p>
<p>How often do you approach your good morning ritual at work with a level 5 approach? How often did you think about your morning greeting at all? Just try the level 5 greeting, and find out the effects yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Tom &amp; Hagar would be curious to hear about your experiences with the tricks they gave you in this article.
