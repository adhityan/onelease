    <p align="left"><strong>Q: What is betahaus?</strong></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>A:</strong>&nbsp;betahaus is a coworking space in&nbsp;<a href="../index.html">Berlin</a>,&nbsp;<a
            href="http://hamburg.betahaus.de/">Hamburg</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.betahaus.bg/">Sofia</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a
            href="http://www.betahaus.es/">Barcelona</a>. We opened the first location in April 2009 in Berlin right at
        Moritzplatz. betahaus is for people who want to work on their own projects while exchanging knowledge, ideas,
        and inspiration with others. It’s there to foster entrepreneurship, creativity, rapid prototyping and innovative
        product development. The community consists of startups, entrepreneurs, corporate teams, freelancers, and
        makers, who to various degrees collaborate and cooperate. betahaus | Berlin currently counts over 500 members.

    <p align="left"><strong>Q: What is coworking?</strong></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>A:</strong> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coworking">Wikipedia</a> gives a
        comprehensive definition:</p>
    <p align="left"><em>“Coworking is an emerging trend for a new pattern for working. Typically work-at-home
        professionals or independent contractors or people who travel frequently end up working in relative isolation.
        Coworking is the social gathering of a group of people, who are still working independently, but who share
        values and who are interested in the synergy that can happen from working with talented people in the same
        space.</em></p>
    <p align="left"><em>Some coworking spaces were developed by nomadic internet entrepreneurs seeking an alternative to
        working in coffeeshops and cafes, or to isolation in independent or home offices.</em></p>
    <p align="left"><em>Business accelerators, business incubators and executive suites do not seem to fit into the
        coworking model, because they often miss the social, collaborative, and informal aspects of the process, with
        management practices closer to that of a Cooperative, including a focus on community rather than profit. Many of
        the coworking participants are also participants in BarCamp and other related open source technology
        activities.”</em></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Q: Why should I choose betahaus?</strong></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>A:</strong> The betahaus is the hotspot for startup and freelancers in Berlin! People who
        are looking for a flexible working space in a collaborative work environment. Many betahaus <a
                href="../community/index.html">members</a> are freelancers who are fed up with sitting at home alone and
        working on their projects in isolation. Others are looking for synergies in order to be able to master bigger
        projects. Around 30% are startup-founders, who are looking for a flexible opportunity for growth. Check out our
        <a href="../blog/index.html">blog</a> for more member stories.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Q: What kinds of people work at betahaus?</strong></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>A:</strong> All kinds of <a href="../community/index.html">people</a> work at betahaus –
        from journalists, photographers, translators, graphic designers, designers, programmers, academics, architects,
        artists, non-governmental organizations and clubs to startups and corporate companies – a creative mix, for
        sure. We introduce our <a href="../community/index.html">members</a> and startups on our <a
                href="../blog/index.html">blog</a> on a regular basis.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Q: Why the name betahaus?</strong></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>A:</strong> To express our idea of a new workplace, we first came up with terms from the
        area of software development, such as “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_version#Beta">beta version</a>”
        or “beta phase”. They best describe the way we’d like to design and develop the betahaus: as an open-ended
        process. We constantly develop the concept further with our users. This is the only possible way as this kind of
        space is based on a completely new concept. At the same time we are convinced that the presence each new user
        enriches the betahaus. „Perpetual beta”: the betahaus is never really complete, but keeps on evolving. During
        our research, we stumbled across the history of the Greek letter „betha”. Its predecessor originates from
        Aramaic, and describes the symbol of a rectangular floor plan of a yard or house with an open door. Finally the
        word „betahaus” was created from this symbol: a real place in the digital world; a fixed point and physical home
        for creative professionals and other “digital Bohemians”.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Q: How did you come up with the idea of founding betahaus?</strong></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>A:</strong> The reason is because we ourselves couldn’t find a place suitable to our way of
        working. As freelance professionals, we needed a flexible infrastructure that fit between our digital and real
        worlds, as well as our work and personal lives. We needed a place where networks could be perpetuated
        continuously, making them visible and tangible.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Q: Who are you?</strong></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>A.:</strong>&nbsp;Originally founded by 6 students in 2009 we now have a large international
        team which is running the daily betahaus activities.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>WORKING</strong></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Q: What’s the working atmosphere like?</strong></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>A: </strong>betahaus is a mixture between open-plan office and library: in the spacious,
        luminous loftish coworking area there’s also talking on the phone and brainstorming, but it’s understood to be
        considerate of the other users. Partitions, shelves and plants provide for generally good acoustics. If you need
        silence, you can go to our old telephone booth and work there without being disturbed. Apart from that, there
        are meeting rooms available for extended discussions and meetings. Anyone looking for complete peace and silence
        can book one of the meeting rooms. Then, for chats and conversations, people go to the Café.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Q: Can I make phone calls at betahaus in peace and quiet?</strong></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>A:</strong> There are various possibilities for making phone calls at betahaus without being
        disturbed. For the extra important phone call you just book one of the meeting rooms. Then there are a number of
        lounges in secluded corners.</p>

    <p align="left"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, conference rooms are available and can hold up to 12 people.
        Projector/flatscreen, flip chart and presentation-equipment can be booked easily with the meeting room. For
        larger groups (up to 150 people), and for events like lectures or panel discussions, exhibitions and wild
        parties you can rent the Café, the Innovation Space, Arena or the Loft. Here you find an <a

        get together the Café is probably the best place.</p>
