He hasn't got bored of it and loves to pass on the excitement as well as all the tricks he's learned throughout the years.    "Today many people spend most of their time in front of a computer screen\, it is a great tool indeed\, but slowly we are losing the capacity of making things with our hands.  With all the years I have been working with wood\, I still find satisfying to make a new piece\, seeing it taking shape\, feeling the quality of the material\, see its color coming out after waxing/oiling it\, I love it!  I would like to pass on this passion for working with wood and experiencing the satisfaction of building something with your hands."  // Llus Mateu\, woodwork instructor //              Any questions? Drop us a line at education@betahaus.de  Please print your ticket and bring it to the workshop!

SUMMARY:Sustainability Drinks #13 - Plastic Free Living
DESCRIPTION:Plastic Free Living  Just in time for Plastic Free July and Plastiktütenfreier Tag Berlin\, Sustainability Drinks is presenting another fantastic event:  Plastic forms an integral part of our every-day life. The most visible is probably the packaging we encounter whenever we go shopping. The detrimental effects of plastic on our health and the environment are well documented (see e.g. the film "Plastic Planet"). With our event we want to provide a some insights to alternatives and kickstart further activities geared towards generating ideas and projects how to address the problem. To achieve maximum impact\, solutions need to target mainstream supermarkets and allow consumers to make the right choices - or eliminate particularly bad choices.  With presentation from Jens Gröger\, Oeko-Institut on "Life Cycle Assessment" and Georg Tarne\, soulbottles on "soulbottles and life as a social entrepreneur."

SUMMARY:Language Transfer
DESCRIPTION:Communication is supposed to be simple\, right?    The truth is that things get lost in translation and in transfer. There are gaps. You’ll know what gaps I mean:     If you’ve read a book in its original language and in a target language   If you’ve pitched or presented and wondered about whether your audience got your message   If you’re working on a text\, on a website or on a book and need a second pair of eyes to help you crisp your content   If you’ve sat in a language class that hasn’t been very engaging to you and you’ve wanted more    So close the gaps: jump\, rocket or build a bridge. We’ll help.    We have over 10 years experience working with people in design\, the health sector\, media\, engineering and academia. If quality     wording and wordology\,   translations and editing\,   language learning\,   language coaching and   teaching and content transfer methods    are on your mind\, come and find me.    Book your spot via eventbrite.    &nbsp;    Looking forward to meeting you\,    Jeanette    Sponsored by NATIVES GmbH &amp; Co. KG    Wir l(i)eben Sprachen.    &nbsp;
