SUMMARY:Product Design
DESCRIPTION:Develop your product    Do you want to turn your creativity into something social-minded and useful? Do you have an idea you want to work on\, or a project in mind? Do you frequently work with designers and think it’d be good to be able to put yourself in their shoes? Or are you simply curious to know what’s behind most of the design projects you encounter?    Twice a week for a month\, you will be learning all there is to know in order to run a successful project\, from basic research and design methodology to knowledge about materials\, production techniques and ecodesign. You will discover the many hidden facets of the design practice: how to integrate a project within a complex system\, how to build a working prototype\, as well as how to communicate and distribute your project.    EARLY BIRD AVAILABLE UNTIL 7TH OF JULY    &nbsp;    SESSION OVERVIEW    Session 1 - INTRODUCTION TO DESIGN:    Discover the many disciplines that form the design practice\, as well as relevant methodology to run a successful project as a design studio - forming work groups\, brainstorming\, collaborative decision-making\, researching and selecting a project.    Session 2  - RESEARCHER'S KIT:    Learn what constraints are common to all design projects\, and form the basics of all future research and development\, as well as specific research techniques - focus group\, persona\, collaborative research… Identify all parameters of your project\, define specific constraints and evaluation guidelines.    Session 3  - GETTING CREATIVE:    Get to know different techniques to boost creativity\, to evaluate and select ideas\, and find out more about standard 2D and 3D drafting techniques. Define potential work directions for your project\, select and draft the most promising ones.    Session 4  - MATERIALS\, PRODUCTION\, ECODESIGN:    Gain basic knowledge of materials and standard production techniques\, and some insight about ecodesign and lifecycle management. Specify your own project's production constraints and possible solutions\, and research specific production techniques.    Session 5  - SYSTEM DESIGN:    Learn to apprehend every design project as part of a system\, with a focus on service\, social &amp; humanitarian design. Work to integrate your own project within a complete and coherent system\, and to imagine complementary items.    Session 6  - IMPLEMENTATION IS KEY:    Learn how to set up an realistic project\, as well as the necessary presentation skills to explain the entire system. Integrate all research and feedback from your own project\, present it and prepare its implementation.    Session 7  - PREPARATION FOR PRODUCTION &amp; PROTOTYPING:    Familiarise yourself with the many tools you will need to make any project go real - realising blueprints\, prototyping\, defining production needs and identifying the best partners for production. Build your own working prototype.    Session 8  - TEST AND ASSESS:    Learn to provide and receive constructive feedback\, to further improve your project and to define a strategy for its implementation. Define future steps to communicate\, distribute and fund your project.    INSTRUCTOR: Regis Lamberthe    The course will be taught by French designer Régis Lemberthe. He moved to Berlin after graduating as a master in “humanitarian design and sustainable living” from Design Academy Eindhoven\, and started working on a variety of projects ranging from conceptual product design (A&amp;Ré Design) and interaction design (Régißtudio) to collaborative design (Enable Berlin) and skill sharing (Maker Lab\, Betahaus Build Or Buy). He has been giving lectures and facilitating workshops at Newcastle Culture Lab\, Agen Musée Des Beaux Arts\, Milan Public Design Festival\, Amsterdam Center for Social and Contemporary Art\, as well as in various places in Berlin.    CERTIFICATE:  After completing this course you will receive a certificate from betahaus | Academy    QUESTIONS:    Drop us a line at academy@betahaus.de
