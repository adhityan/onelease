SUMMARY:Betahaus Food Assembly's weekly collection
DESCRIPTION:Every week you find great products direct from local quality farms.    1. Simply register as a member of the Betahaus Food Assembly on www.thefoodassembly.de. This is free and doesn't commit you to ordering the same produce each week.    2. Shop online. We've got organic vegetable and fruit\, meat\, eggs\, cheese\, honey\, jams\, cakes\, and much more to discover.    3. Collect your local produce every Thursday at The Betahaus in Kreuzberg between 5-7pm.    It's fairer\, better and (for a lot of people) closer than the local supermarket. Come and meet the producers and support local farms and craft.    We hope to see you soon!    &nbsp;
