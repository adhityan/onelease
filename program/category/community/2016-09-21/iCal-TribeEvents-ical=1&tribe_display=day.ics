SUMMARY:Data science, machine learning &amp; AI
DESCRIPTION:betahaus | Office Hours are one-on-one free consultancy sessions (30 mins) with experts from our community to our community.    Event Description    Big data is suddenly everywhere. Its applications seem to be limitless and its role in our lives is becoming increasingly important. However\, big data without data science is blind. In order to derive useful insights from data\, the power of machine learning needs to be unleashed. Only then may businesses benefit from new perspectives\, such as to understand their customers better or to monitor key processes in real-time. But is that really “the new oil”? How does it work? And what use is it to me and my business? In this Office Hours session (1-on-1)\, Paul helps you disentangle the world of data science\, machine learning\, and artificial intelligence\, and talks you through how that might apply to your project.
