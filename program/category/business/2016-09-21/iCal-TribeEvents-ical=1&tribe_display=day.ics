SUMMARY:Data science, machine learning &amp; AI
DESCRIPTION:betahaus | Office Hours are one-on-one free consultancy sessions (30 mins) with experts from our community to our community.    Event Description    Big data is suddenly everywhere. Its applications seem to be limitless and its role in our lives is becoming increasingly important. However\, big data without data science is blind. In order to derive useful insights from data\, the power of machine learning needs to be unleashed. Only then may businesses benefit from new perspectives\, such as to understand their customers better or to monitor key processes in real-time. But is that really “the new oil”? How does it work? And what use is it to me and my business? In this Office Hours session (1-on-1)\, Paul helps you disentangle the world of data science\, machine learning\, and artificial intelligence\, and talks you through how that might apply to your project.

SUMMARY:Meetup: Monetization "Monday" Berlin - Monetization of Content
DESCRIPTION:Monetisation of content matters to just about everyone\, but it is still a major challenge. What do we know\, what do we still not know\, about users willingness to pay for content online?    This event is trying to sketch an overview over the main monetisation concepts\, best practices\, limitations and some academic research.    The objective is to start a dialogue across different lines of online business (journalism\, video\, music\, gaming\, etc.) towards a new deal for content creators and those\, who love content.    This instance is the very first of what hopefully will be a regular feature for all those\, who want to discuss\, learn and network all around monetisation of content.    Open to everyone and free to attend.    PLEASE NOTE: 21st September is a Wednesday (despite what is in the headline)!!!!!    Agenda:    Short introduction into monetisation of content    Lots and lots of discussion\, why monetisation of content matters from your point of view? Why you think it is important? What you want to talk and discuss about in future meetups and what your priorities are (learn\, network\, best practice\, etc)?    Please tweet and email the link http://meetu.ps/2ZVxcC and bring as many people as you know are interested in monetising content!
