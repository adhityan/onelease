SUMMARY:Meetup: Monetization "Monday" Berlin - Monetization of Content
DESCRIPTION:Monetisation of content matters to just about everyone\, but it is still a major challenge. What do we know\, what do we still not know\, about users willingness to pay for content online?    This event is trying to sketch an overview over the main monetisation concepts\, best practices\, limitations and some academic research.    The objective is to start a dialogue across different lines of online business (journalism\, video\, music\, gaming\, etc.) towards a new deal for content creators and those\, who love content.    This instance is the very first of what hopefully will be a regular feature for all those\, who want to discuss\, learn and network all around monetisation of content.    Open to everyone and free to attend.    PLEASE NOTE: 21st September is a Wednesday (despite what is in the headline)!!!!!    Agenda:    Short introduction into monetisation of content    Lots and lots of discussion\, why monetisation of content matters from your point of view? Why you think it is important? What you want to talk and discuss about in future meetups and what your priorities are (learn\, network\, best practice\, etc)?    Please tweet and email the link http://meetu.ps/2ZVxcC and bring as many people as you know are interested in monetising content!
