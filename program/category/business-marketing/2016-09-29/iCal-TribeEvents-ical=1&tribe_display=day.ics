SUMMARY:3 Ways of Pitching
DESCRIPTION:A 360° Workshop on Pitching   When you pitch you have a minute amount of time to make a good first impression so that your audience feels confident in what you have to say. You want to shine when speaking to them and make them connect with your product immediately!  Your body language tells a lot\, but the crucial part of a successful pitch is what you have to say\, the structure and personification of your story. In this 6-hour workshop you will learn how to write your pitch according to your audience. Win that first impression and take your business to skyrocketing heights.  You will work thoroughly on ways to pitch your idea to potential customers\, investors\, sponsors\, media\, supporters etc. You will gain in-depth understanding on how the concept of your idea needs to be tailored to your audience’s life. Learn to carefully place your idea in people’s minds without using the standard sales pitch.  This is perfect for startups\, small businesses and marketing &amp; sales professionals.  SESSION OVERVIEW:  During the session you will be working hands-on on developing your pitch and adapting the concept. Through analysing examples you will learn how to win attention and respect within 30 seconds. By the end of the workshop you will obtain a practical step-by-step method to generate your pitch and have a prepared pitch for your individual business situation\, to be used online as well as offline.
