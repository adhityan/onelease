SUMMARY:This is Concrete
DESCRIPTION:Bringing mortar Art  When talking about concrete you most likely think of architecture or urban space. It really isn’t the first material that pops into your head when talking about domestic objects or jewellery\, is it?  However\, this workshop offers precisely that: for you guys to come and design your own decorative and domestic projects made entirely of concrete.  During the workshop you’ll be learning a little something about how to work with this material. Working on a small scale you’ll discover the many possibilities offered by it in terms of colour and texture. Learn to build your own moulds and get a custom object off the cast. If you are more about result than process\, there will be an option to follow pre-made patterns and create one of the products shown on the photos.  SESSION OVERVIEW:  Session 1  After the introduction to concrete and getting to know all the possibilities of it\, you will get your head into building your own model!  Session 2  After your amazing model gets a chance to dry you will work on your final creation: polishing\, adding\, colouring etc  INSTRUCTOR: Regis Lemberthe  Régis Lemberthe moved to Berlin after graduating as a master in “humanitarian design and sustainable living” from Design Academy Eindhoven\, and started working on a variety of projects ranging from conceptual product design (A&amp;Ré Design) and interaction design (Régißtudio) to collaborative design (Enable Berlin) and skill sharing (Maker Lab\, Betahaus Build Or Buy).  He has been giving lectures and facilitating workshops at Newcastle Culture Lab\, Agen Musée Des Beaux Arts\, Milan Public Design Festival\, Amsterdam Center for Social and Contemporary Art\, as well as in various places in Berlin.  MATERIALS:  Concrete is provided and included into the price\, but please bring along packaging for creating moulds! (note: the packages must be water containing\, anything from milk cartons etc. works perfectly!). Wear clothes\, you do not mind getting dirty it is concrete after all.  QUESTIONS:  Drop us a line at academy@betahaus.de  Please print your ticket and bring it to the workshop!
