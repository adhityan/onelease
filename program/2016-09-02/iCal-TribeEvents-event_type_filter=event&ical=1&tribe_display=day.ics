SUMMARY:Design Thinking
DESCRIPTION:Learn to disrupt a change     Design Thinking is more than just a buzzword it is solving complex problems\, to innovate collaboratively\, and create holistic\, sustainable solutions with a human-centered focus. In this one day intensive workshop you will harness the power of Design Thinking.    The goal of the workshop is to understand and experience the different steps of the Design Thinking process by applying it to different challenges.
