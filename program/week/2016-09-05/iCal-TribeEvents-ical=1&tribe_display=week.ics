SUMMARY:Patents – Protection and Monetization of Technical Inventions
DESCRIPTION:betahaus | Office Hours are one-on-one free consultancy sessions (30 mins) with experts from our community to our community.    Event Description    If you work on a technical project\, you might be able to protect its results by filing a patent application. There is also a good chance that other peoples’ patents will have an impact on what you do.    A single patent\, if you own it\, may turn a half-baked idea into an investment opportunity. A single patent may also sink three years of hard work\, if someone else owns it. Investors tend to take intellectual property – “IP”\, of which patents are the most important example - extremely seriously. Billions are exchanged every year in IP-driven transactions.    In this office hour (1 on 1 session) we will listen to your plans and problems\, and point out what IP issues are most likely to matter to your business. Where possible\, we will help you to find solutions.    Key topics we often consult on are:      Can I protect my invention? How much does that cost?    Does it make sense to file a patent in my situation?    How do I know what other patents are out there?    What do I need to do if I want to license a patent? How is this done?    About Event Holder    We are patent attorneys with degrees in different technical fields\, from engineering to chemistry. In order to select the right attorney for your field\, please send us a short description of your topic of interest within IP (to: office@mittepatent.de\, subject: betahaus office hours). Anything you tell us will be kept completely confidential.      Knut Seliger is a mechanical engineer\, with a focus on automotive and hardware engineering.    Ben Jesko Schulz is a physicist\, with considerable experience in IT-based inventions\, hardware and physics.    Claas Junghans is a chemist (and serial entrepreneur) with a focus on the strategic aspects of start-up IP work.    Important Information      Office Hours is a one-on-one consultation session. Not a group workshop or a presentation. Please ensure you come prepared with your own questions.    Once you arrive\, please go to reception.    Only one session (30 minutes) per person per Office Hours day.    To secure your spot please register in advance and send an email to office@mittepatent.de to introduce yourself and explain your topic of interest in order for the right attorney to be allocated to you    If you would like to cancel\, please have the courtesy to email office@mittepatent.de to let them know.    Please print your ticket and bring it to the session!

SUMMARY:Vegan Cheese
DESCRIPTION:Discover new tastes     Nuts\, beans and seeds are a protein-rich\, nutritious and affordable part of vegan (or not) diet. Learn the secrets behind making these foods into 'cheeses'\, dips and spreads that are easy to digest and packed with flavour.  In an anti-bacterial age\, fermentation is quickly becoming a lost art. We are here to reclaim it as an energy efficient food-preservation technique which is rooted in our cultural histories. We are captivated and inspired by the way fermented foods engage our senses and enhance whole food eating.  ABOUT THE WORKSHOP   The workshop will be interactive and informative. Through taste\, touch\, sight\, smell and discussion you will explore the fascinating microbiological processes that turns nuts\, beans and seeds into probiotic condiments. Each participant will have the chance to sample and join in discussions about the benefits of fermented foods. We will explore our individual taste preferences and then delve into the do-it-yourself seed cheese making station so everyone can go home with their very own creation.      INSTRUCTOR: ALEXIS GOERTZ  The 25 year old Canadian Bacteria-Barista\, Alexis\, co-founded Edible Alchemy in Winnipeg\, Canada in 2013\, and after exploring more of the world of fermentation over many travels brought Edible Alchemy to Berlin in September 2014. The enthusiasm and desire to share about the wondrous world of fermentation has brought Edible Alchemy to classrooms\, festivals\, farmer’s markets\, rooftops\, studio spaces and on European and Canadian tours. Working with fermentation is an accessible way to have a little laboratory in the kitchen\, which Alexis loves doing experiments and seeing people get really excited about taking back traditional food\, deskilling to create self-reliance.  MATERIALS:  All the materials will be provided at the workshop.  QUESTIONS:  Drop us a line at academy@betahaus.de
