SUMMARY:Drupal Berlin Usergroup
DESCRIPTION:Bei dieser monatlichen Veranstaltung treffen sich die Berliner Anwender und Entwickler des CMS DRUPAL.    Drupal ist eine unter der GNU General Public License veröffentlichte und von einer breiten Community stetig weiterentwickelte Software.    Sie dient in erster Linie dem Erstellen\, Publizieren und Organisieren verschiedenster Inhalte einer Website.    Aufgrund ihres modularen Aufbaus ist in höchstem Maße ein flexibler Einsatz in allen nur erdenklichen Bereichen möglich.    Also egal\, ob Intranet oder Internet\, ob e-Government\, Commerce oder Community\, ob redaktionelle Inhalte oder "user generated content".    Drupal ist die Lösung! Bei unserem Treffen im betahaus geht es uns um einen möglichst breiten Austausch. Jeder Interessierte\, unabhängig vom Wissensstand\, ist willkommen!!! Es werden Sessions und Flashtalks gehalten. Individuelle Probleme können angesprochen und hoffentlich auch gelöst werden.    Informiert euch vorab über geplante Vorträge und stimmt über Themenvorschläge ab.    Join The Drupal Community!

SUMMARY:Vegetable Fermentation
DESCRIPTION:Release the flavour  In an anti-bacterial age\, fermentation is quickly becoming a lost art. We are here to reclaim it as an energy efficient food-preservation technique which is rooted in our cultural histories. We are captivated and inspired by the way fermented foods engage our senses and enhance whole food eating.  Discover the science and unique flavours of fermented vegetables around the world. From classic sauerkrauts to pickled Asian vegetables to the spicy and tangy flavours of South American cuisine. Every one will have the opportunity to make a custom kraut. Bring a curious appetite.  ABOUT THE WORKSHOP  In this workshop we will talk about everything PROBIOTICS and fermentation. Alexis will introduce to you the importance of your own micro-biome by introducing fermented foods\, traditional and cultural uses\, nutrition and the microbiology behind their creation. We will also discuss resources as well as tips and safety tricks of this culinary art form.  Everyone should come with a curious appetite and open mind and leave with a jar of delicious\, custom made vegetable kraut that one can observe during the weeks ahead.  INSTRUCTOR: ALEXIS GOERTZ  The 25 year old Canadian Bacteria-Barista\, Alexis\, co-founded Edible Alchemy in Winnipeg\, Canada in 2013\, and after exploring more of the world of fermentation over many travels brought Edible Alchemy to Berlin in September 2014. The enthusiasm and desire to share about the wondrous world of fermentation has brought Edible Alchemy to classrooms\, festivals\, farmer’s markets\, rooftops\, studio spaces and on European and Canadian tours. Working with fermentation is an accessible way to have a little laboratory in the kitchen\, which Alexis loves doing experiments and seeing people get really excited about taking back traditional food\, deskilling to create self-reliance.  MATERIALS:  All the materials will be provided at the workshop.  QUESTIONS:  Drop us a line at academy@betahaus.de

SUMMARY:Lightroom Intensive
DESCRIPTION:Create art with photography   Adobe Lightroom has been designed to integrate\, in one single program\, all the features involved in the photographer’s workflow. It’s powerful\, yet intuitive. Learn all you need to know to start editing\, organising and publishing your digital photos.  You’ll quickly learn how to make your photos shine\, how to manage your photo library so that you can quickly find what you are looking for and how to create a web page and a slideshow with them.  We will combine theoretical explanations with practical exercises using images provided by the instructor or your own ones\, if you prefer.  SESSION OVERVIEW   Session 1   After a quick introduction to see all the possibilities that Lightroom has to offer\, we will learn how to import photos to our library and how to apply some basic edition to them.    Session 2   Lightroom is extremely powerful when it comes to organising your images. Let’s make the most of it! And let’s also go deeper into its editing capabilities.    Session 3   In this session we will go into the advanced editing tools and the special effects in depth. Who said you take a picture when you release the shutter button? That’s only the beginning! Finally\, it’s time to close the circle. With all the processed material along the course we will generate a web page and a slideshow.

SUMMARY:Drupal Berlin Usergroup
DESCRIPTION:Bei dieser monatlichen Veranstaltung treffen sich die Berliner Anwender und Entwickler des CMS DRUPAL.    Drupal ist eine unter der GNU General Public License veröffentlichte und von einer breiten Community stetig weiterentwickelte Software.    Sie dient in erster Linie dem Erstellen\, Publizieren und Organisieren verschiedenster Inhalte einer Website.    Aufgrund ihres modularen Aufbaus ist in höchstem Maße ein flexibler Einsatz in allen nur erdenklichen Bereichen möglich.    Also egal\, ob Intranet oder Internet\, ob e-Government\, Commerce oder Community\, ob redaktionelle Inhalte oder "user generated content".    Drupal ist die Lösung! Bei unserem Treffen im betahaus geht es uns um einen möglichst breiten Austausch. Jeder Interessierte\, unabhängig vom Wissensstand\, ist willkommen!!! Es werden Sessions und Flashtalks gehalten. Individuelle Probleme können angesprochen und hoffentlich auch gelöst werden.    Informiert euch vorab über geplante Vorträge und stimmt über Themenvorschläge ab.    Join The Drupal Community!

Twice a week for a month\, you will be learning all there is to know in order to run a successful project\, from basic research and design methodology to knowledge about materials\, production techniques and ecodesign. You will discover the many hidden facets of the design practice: how to integrate a project within a complex system\, how to build a working prototype\, as well as how to communicate and distribute your project.    EARLY BIRD AVAILABLE UNTIL 7TH OF JULY    &nbsp;    SESSION OVERVIEW    Session 1 - INTRODUCTION TO DESIGN:    Discover the many disciplines that form the design practice\, as well as relevant methodology to run a successful project as a design studio - forming work groups\, brainstorming\, collaborative decision-making\, researching and selecting a project.    Session 2  - RESEARCHER'S KIT:    Learn what constraints are common to all design projects\, and form the basics of all future research and development\, as well as specific research techniques - focus group\, persona\, collaborative research… Identify all parameters of your project\, define specific constraints and evaluation guidelines.    Session 3  - GETTING CREATIVE:    Get to know different techniques to boost creativity\, to evaluate and select ideas\, and find out more about standard 2D and 3D drafting techniques.
