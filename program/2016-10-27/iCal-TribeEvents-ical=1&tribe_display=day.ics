SUMMARY:Betahaus Food Assembly's weekly collection
DESCRIPTION:Every week you find great products direct from local quality farms.    1. Simply register as a member of the Betahaus Food Assembly on www.thefoodassembly.de. This is free and doesn't commit you to ordering the same produce each week.    2. Shop online. We've got organic vegetable and fruit\, meat\, eggs\, cheese\, honey\, jams\, cakes\, and much more to discover.    3. Collect your local produce every Thursday at The Betahaus in Kreuzberg between 5-7pm.    It's fairer\, better and (for a lot of people) closer than the local supermarket. Come and meet the producers and support local farms and craft.    We hope to see you soon!    &nbsp;

SUMMARY:UX Design &amp; Usability
DESCRIPTION:Develop an interaction-rich experience  User experience design and usability are critical factors for all companies to develop sustainable customer relationships. Also\, as a rule of thumb\, you can say\, every 1 euro you invest in Usability and UX\, saves 10 euros in development and 100 euros after the initial product launch. These are only two facts\, why there is such a high demand of UX experts at the moment.  This UX design &amp; Usability course for beginners will teach you all the important basics from scratch about user centered design\, web and application design and usability testing. In each session\, we will explore the most relevant topics in theory and do practical exercises along an imaginary project that you later can use as a first example in your portfolio.

We will get familiar with VIMM analysis\, mental models and basic gestalt principles. You will also learn how to create a design strategy.  Session 2  In the second session\, you will learn basic knowledge about user centered design. After the theoretical part\, we will practice how to create personae\, conduct user interviews\, perform a task flow analysis and develop a roadmap for the project.

Session 4  In the last session of the course\, we will cover the topic of practical usability testing. After a theoretical introduction\, we will perform our own card sorting to test our information architecture\, develop interview guidelines for a usability test and perform our own little test in the group.  &nbsp;  INSTRUCTOR: NICOLE FUHR  Nicole Fuhr is an empathetic user experience designer with a behavioral science and marketing background and 7 years of experience in creating digital products and coworking with graphic designers\, developers and product managers.
