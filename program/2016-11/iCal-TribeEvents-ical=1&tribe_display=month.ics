SUMMARY:Drupal Berlin Usergroup
DESCRIPTION:Bei dieser monatlichen Veranstaltung treffen sich die Berliner Anwender und Entwickler des CMS DRUPAL.    Drupal ist eine unter der GNU General Public License veröffentlichte und von einer breiten Community stetig weiterentwickelte Software.    Sie dient in erster Linie dem Erstellen\, Publizieren und Organisieren verschiedenster Inhalte einer Website.    Aufgrund ihres modularen Aufbaus ist in höchstem Maße ein flexibler Einsatz in allen nur erdenklichen Bereichen möglich.    Also egal\, ob Intranet oder Internet\, ob e-Government\, Commerce oder Community\, ob redaktionelle Inhalte oder "user generated content".    Drupal ist die Lösung! Bei unserem Treffen im betahaus geht es uns um einen möglichst breiten Austausch. Jeder Interessierte\, unabhängig vom Wissensstand\, ist willkommen!!! Es werden Sessions und Flashtalks gehalten. Individuelle Probleme können angesprochen und hoffentlich auch gelöst werden.    Informiert euch vorab über geplante Vorträge und stimmt über Themenvorschläge ab.    Join The Drupal Community!

SUMMARY:The Sound Box

You can buy cajons online or in music stores; however\, they're not difficult to make and let's be honest making one yourself is not only really cool it will sound even more better!  So from now on when you will meet your friends for an evening full of music\, food and drink\, you can bring your very own Cajón with you and play with then anywhere you want!  SESSION OVERVIEW    Session 1  We will kick off the course with a quick history and usage recap of the Cajon and getting to know more about the different wood types we will use. Right after that you’ll get your hands dirty! You’ll be making it’s shelve out of wood. You’ll receive all materials already precut by our master and the bits you need to assemble into the Cajón. In order to make it perfect and sound just right\, you’ll need to work on the pieces by using different tools such as sanders and drills. Once your pieces are ready\, you will take the leap into assembling it all together\, making sure everything is aligned.    Session 2   The second session we’ll devote to finishing the structure and assembling the Cajón together. Making sure the sounds are clean and accurate. To finish the course in a musical mood you will give your Cajón a try.    INSTRUCTORS: Lluis Mateu  Lluis Mateu is a woodworking enthusiast with more than 25 years of experience.

SUMMARY:Patents – Protection and Monetization of Technical Inventions
DESCRIPTION:betahaus | Office Hours are one-on-one free consultancy sessions (30 mins) with experts from our community to our community.    Event Description    If you work on a technical project\, you might be able to protect its results by filing a patent application. There is also a good chance that other peoples’ patents will have an impact on what you do.    A single patent\, if you own it\, may turn a half-baked idea into an investment opportunity. A single patent may also sink three years of hard work\, if someone else owns it. Investors tend to take intellectual property – “IP”\, of which patents are the most important example - extremely seriously. Billions are exchanged every year in IP-driven transactions.    In this office hour (1 on 1 session) we will listen to your plans and problems\, and point out what IP issues are most likely to matter to your business. Where possible\, we will help you to find solutions.    Key topics we often consult on are:      Can I protect my invention? How much does that cost?    Does it make sense to file a patent in my situation?    How do I know what other patents are out there?    What do I need to do if I want to license a patent? How is this done?    About Event Holder    We are patent attorneys with degrees in different technical fields\, from engineering to chemistry. In order to select the right attorney for your field\, please send us a short description of your topic of interest within IP (to: office@mittepatent.de\, subject: betahaus office hours). Anything you tell us will be kept completely confidential.      Knut Seliger is a mechanical engineer\, with a focus on automotive and hardware engineering.    Ben Jesko Schulz is a physicist\, with considerable experience in IT-based inventions\, hardware and physics.    Claas Junghans is a chemist (and serial entrepreneur) with a focus on the strategic aspects of start-up IP work.    Important Information      Office Hours is a one-on-one consultation session. Not a group workshop or a presentation. Please ensure you come prepared with your own questions.    To secure your spot please register in advance by sending an email to office@mittepatent.de. In your email please indicate which 30-minute time slot you would like on the day and explain your topic of interest in order for the right attorney to be allocated to you. Your preferred 30-minute time slot must be within the specified time frame for this Office Hours session    Once you arrive\, please go to reception. The event will take place there.    Only one session (30 minutes) per person per Office Hours day.    If you would like to cancel\, please have the courtesy to email office@mittepatent.de to let them know.

SUMMARY:Code in Ruby
DESCRIPTION:Focus on simplicity and productivity  If you’re nowadays work within a startup\, the earliest questions you will need to answer will be: What is the best programming language for my startup? Even with limited experience you’re still able to develop your own web application. In this case a great software you always can consider is Ruby.    When you spend hours and hours a day writing code\, it’s the little things that make a huge difference. Ruby’s usability is much easier than in other programming language\, because the language is super flexible and very forgiving and speaks in terms that are more human and less computer. This way you will spend more time absorbing programming fundamentals and less time banging your head against your desk.    SESSION OVERVIEW     Session 1  In this session you will get to know your tutor and classmates and get straight into coding. We will set up your working environment and have a look at online code editors and cloud workspaces like Cloud9 or Nitrous. You will learn the basics of the Ruby programming language and by the end of the session you will have your first Rails app up and running in the cloud.    Session 2   This session starts by introducing the basics of every Rails app: models\, views\, controllers\, and routes. You will learn how to use models to create\, read\, update\, and delete records in the database (CRUD). We will write controller actions to handle incoming web requests and design clean and flexible views using layouts\, partials\, and helpers. At the end of the day you will have built your own interactive blog app.  Session 3   In this session we will build a more ambitious project. You will learn how to use git to version control your code and how to host your git repository with GitHub. We will also take a look at more advanced aspects of Rails like testing\, internationalization (I18n) and sending emails. By the end of the session you will have built a fancy music catalog app and deployed it to the web.    Session 4  Throughout the final session\, you will learn how to use a test-first development approach to confidently add new features. You will write and run high-level feature specs using Capybara and lower-level model specs using RSpec. Creating a Rails app that just works isn't the same as designing a good Rails app. So we will take a step further and cover design techniques for removing duplication and encapsulating business logic. You will also get tips and tricks used by the professionals to get the most out of Rails.
